This study is aimed at evaluating the effect of kolaviron on kolanut-induced oxidative stress in developing rat brain.\n\nTwenty-five adult pregnant Wistar rats weighing between 160 and 180g were used for the experiment. They were randomly divided into five groups of five animals each. The animals were fed with standard diets of mice cubes and water provided ad libitum. The control rats received water and cornoil, while the experimental animals received 200 mg/kg body weight of kolanut (kn), 200 mg/kg of kolaviron (kv), and 200 mg/kg body weight of vitamin E which served as a standard antioxidant with cornoil as vehicle orally in pre- and post-natal life. After birth, gross morphometry and behavioural changes of the pups of days 1, 7, 14, 21 and 28 postpartum were evaluated. Blood samples were collected from pups of day 21 for hematological, liver and renal function analyses, while the brains of pups of day 21 postpartum were preserved in phosphate buffer at a temperature of 4oC and pH 7.4 for biochemical analysis.\n\nThere were significant alterations in the gross morphometry and behavioural parameters studied in the treated animals compared with the control at p< 0.05. There were elevated levels of RBC, WBC and platelets in the treated group compared with the control at p< 0.05. However, no significant change was observed in the PCV, Hb, liver and renal function parameters studied at p>0.05. A non-significant increase in levels of malondialdehyde, MDA, a bye-product of lipid peroxidation in the kolanut group was observed. However, administration of kolaviron and vitamin E non-significantly (p>0.05) reversed these changes.\n\nIn conclusion, maternal consumption of kolanut induced mild oxidative stress and the administration of kolaviron and vitamin E decreased the rate at which kolanut induced oxidative stress in developing rat brain.", "full_text": ""},

In this study, the analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of the methanolic extract (METC) and fractions (ethyl acetate, F1 and n-hexane, F2) of Tetracarpidium conophorum leaf were evaluated in rat and mice.\n\nThe analgesic activity was evaluated using acetic acid-induced writhing, formalin-induced paw licking and hot plate test models. Carrageenan-induced paw oedema was used to assess anti-inflammatory activity in rats. The mechanism of action of (TC) was explored by the use of naloxone, a non-selective opioid receptor blocker.\n\nThe highest analgesic effect was observed in F2 extract at 57.21% inhibition and was further studied on various analgesic and anti-inflammatory models in graded doses.  F2 significantly inhibited the late phase of formalin-induced paw licking and prolong hot plate latency at 55\u00b11\u00b0C. The n-hexane fraction also significantly inhibited carrageenan-induced paw oedema in rats at 100 and 200mg/kg doses significantly (p< 0.001) and reduced paw licking response by 85.08% compared with control. Naloxone, an opioid receptor antagonist, did not significantly affect the changes observed with n-hexane fraction, thus ruling out the possibility of the involvement of opioid receptors in the analgesic actions of Tetracarpidium conophorum. Phytochemical screening showed that the leaf extracts contain alkaloids, tannins, saponins and cardenolides.\n\nThe investigations showed that Tetracarpidium conophorum possesses significant anti-nociceptive and anti-inflammatory activities that should be explored.", "full_text": ""},

Blood specimens from deep finger pricks of 730 children aged between 0-2 years were examined for malaria parasites using Field stains method. ABO and Rhesus blood group antigens tests were also performed using standard tile protocols. Of all the children admitted into the study, 445 were sick while 285 were apparently healthy. The prevalence of malaria parasites was significantly higher (P = 0.00047) among the sick children (69.8%) than the apparently healthy children (30.2%). The most prevalent blood group was O (55.7%) and the Rhesus D antigen was positive for 98.4% of all the children. The prevalence of blood group B among the sick children was significantly lower (P = 0.00373) than the other blood group types. There is no association between malaria infection and ABO blood groups but the prevalence of higher malaria parasite density was significantly greater (P = 0.0404) in children with blood group A (7.7%).

ABSTRACT The ABO and Rhesus blood group systems are very important clinical tools that are commonly used in blood transfusion and their associations with various disease conditions have been widely reported. This study investigated the distribution of these blood group systems and assessed the association of malaria infection with the ABO blood groups among children in Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. Blood specimens from deep finger pricks of 730 children aged between 0-2 years were examined for malaria parasites using Field stains method. ABO and Rhesus blood group antigens tests were also performed using standard tile protocols. Of all the children admitted into the study, 445 were sick while 285 were apparently healthy. The prevalence of malaria parasites was significantly higher (P = 0.00047) among the sick children (69.8%) than the apparently healthy children (30.2%). The most prevalent blood group was O (55.7%) and the Rhesus D antigen was positive for 98.4% of all the children. The prevalence of blood group B among the sick children was significantly lower (P = 0.00373) than the other blood group types. There is no association between malaria infection and ABO blood groups but the prevalence of higher malaria parasite density was significantly greater (P = 0.0404) in children with blood group A (7.7%). In conclusion, blood group O was the most prevalent blood group in the study and children with blood group A appeared to be more susceptible to higher level of malaria parasitemia.

Phytochemical analysis was carried out using standard procedures. The plant extracts were active against the test organisms at concentrations ranging from 3.125-100 mg/mL. The methanol extracts were more active than the aqueous extracts with the highest inhibition against the yeasts, Candida albicans and Candida krusei (MIC values of 3.125 mg/mL and 6.25 mg/mL respectively). Epidermophyton floccosum and Trichophyton interdigitale were the least inhibited of all the fungal strains. Phytochemical screening revealed the presence of tannins, anthraquinones, flavonoids, cardiac glycosides, alkaloids and saponins. The anti-fungal activity of Daniella oliveri as shown in this study indicates that the plant has the potential of utilisation in the development of chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of relevant fungal infections.

The interaction or binding of the multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) was investigated in order to discover if it brings about any significant changes of the DNA double helix using CD spectra of the CT-DNA at two concentration levels of MWCNT representing an increasing MWCNT/DNA molar ratio. In addition, spectrophotometric titrations between MWCNT and CT-DNA were carried out in order to utilize spectral changes as a means of detecting specific binding modes of either intercalation or degradation of DNA. Interactions of MWCNT induced significant changes in the CD spectra of the B-form of natural DNA. The intensities of the positive CD band at 280 nm decreased significantly. This decrease was found to be concentration-dependent. Following spectrophotometric titrations; specific subtle conformational changes were observed with a molar ratio combination of 2:1 between MWCNT and CT-DNA and these were characterized by a formation constant of the order of 103 M-1 and a negative Gibbs free energy suggesting that MWCNT avidly binds to DNA. Thermodynamic considerations revealed that electrostatic interactions between the DNA base pairs and the MWCNT are taking place accounting for the negative free energy change, positive enthalpy change with a small entropy change. The results obtained in the study of the binding interactions of MWCNT with DNA confirm that a cytogenetic effect of MWCNT with DNA is a possibility in vivo.

ABSTRACT The study was aimed at evaluating the changes in haematological parameters and erythrocyte osmotic fragility in lame and aged horses administered with resveratrol supplement (Equithrive joint\u00ae). A total of 16 horses of both sexes, aged 18 \u00b1 0.65 and showing lameness grade 3 were used for the study. The horses weighed 350-450 kg and comprised 8 horses which were administered with resveratrol supplement for 4 weeks and 8 others, which served as controls and given only Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast strain used as carrier in the supplement. Blood samples were collected from each horse before supplementation and at weekly intervals for 4 weeks of the experiment. Haematological parameters and erythrocyte osmotic fragility were determined by standard methods. Equithrive joint\u00ae concentration and erythrocyte counts in the treated horses while total leucocyte, neutrophil and eosinophil counts decreased with the untreated horses. Erythrocyte osmotic fragility test showed decreased haemolysis in the treated horses.
